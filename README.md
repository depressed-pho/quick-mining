## Usage

FIXME

### Special cases

* **Log-like blocks**: Mining logs and woods (stripped or not) with an axe
  also mines non-player-placed leaves surrounding them. This is a fast
  simulation of decaying so the axe don't lose durability for this, and its
  enchantments don't apply. If you want to gather leaf blocks, mine them
  with shears or a Silk Touch hoe.
* **Mangrove trees**: Mining mangrove logs or roots with an axe mines the
  entire mangrove tree, including moss carpets touching them.
* **Azalea leaves**: Mining azalea leaves (flowering or not) with a hoe or
  shears also mines the other variants.
* **Huge Mushrooms**: Mining mushroom blocks (red or brown) with an axe
  also mines mushroom stems and vice versa.
* **Huge Nether Fungi**: Mining nether wart blocks (warped or not) with a
  hoe also mines surrounding shroomlights and vice versa.

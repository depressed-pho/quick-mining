FIXME: more description

## Usage

FIXME

### Special cases

* **Log-like blocks**: Mining logs and woods (stripped or not) with an axe
  also mines non-player-placed leaves surrounding them. This is a fast
  simulation of decaying so the axe don't lose durability for this, and its
  enchantments don't apply. If you want to gather leaf blocks, mine them
  with shears or a Silk Touch hoe.
* **Mangrove trees**: Mining mangrove logs or roots with an axe mines the
  entire mangrove tree, including moss carpets touching them.
